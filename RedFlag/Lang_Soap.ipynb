      "Conversation Stage: Subjective: the subjective section covers how the patient is feeling and what they report about their specific symptoms. The main topic, symptom or issue that the patient describes is known as the Chief Complaint (CC). There may be more than one CC, and the main CC may not be what the patient initially reports on. As their physician, you need to ask them as many questions as possible so you can identify the appropriate CC. A History of Present Illness (HPI) also belongs in this section. This includes questions like: When did the symptoms begin? When did you first notice the CC? Where is the CC located? What makes the CC better? What makes the CC worse? Hint 1: It is a good idea to include direct quotes from the patient in this section. Hint 2: When you write the subjective section, you need to be as concise as possible. This may mean compacting the information that the patient has given you to get the information across succinctly. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.\n"
